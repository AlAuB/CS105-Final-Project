**Dataset: Used Cars**

**Description:** 
 
 The autos.csv dataset is a comprehensive collection of valuable data about used cars, and provides insight into how the cars are being sold, what price they are being sold for, and all the details about their condition. 
 
 **Research Tasks:** (may change later):
 
- Analyze the relationship between car prices and age (year of registration) using a linear regression model to suggest which cars provide the best value for money.
- Analyze the relationship between car prices and kilometer using a linear regression model to suggest which cars provide the best value for money and worth buying.
- Use classification models to predict vehicle types/model based on features like powerPS, price, brand, etc.
